## Building Bézier Curves with Divide and Conquer based Midpoint Algorithm
Bézier curves are smooth curves that are often used in graphic design, animation, and manufacturing. This curve is created by connecting several control points, which aredetermine the shape and direction of the curve.The way to make it is quite easy, namely by determine control points and connect them with curves. Bézier curves havemany uses in real life, such as the pen tool, smooth and realistic animations, create complex and precise product designs, and create beautiful and unique fonts. The advantage of using Bézier curves is that they are easy to change and manipulate, so that it can produce precise designs that suit your needs.

## Requirement
Python 

numpy

matplotlib

## How to Run?

1. Go to main.py on src folder.
2. Then just run it.
3. The program will starting.

## Note
If you want to see the execution time of the DNC algorithm then close the curve first.
